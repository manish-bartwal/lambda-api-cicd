set up an end-to-end CI/CD flow where a developer pushes code to a GitHub repository, which automatically triggers an AWS CodePipeline. The pipeline should deploy the updated code to an AWS Lambda function, and this Lambda should be integrated with Amazon API Gateway. Once deployed, the API Gateway endpoint must be accessible via a browser and should display the output returned by the Lambda function.
